<h1>Chef and the cookbooks</h1>
<h2>Chef</h2>
<p>Chef is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure.
<h2>Cookbook</h2>
<p>A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution.</p>
<p>Each cookbook defines a scenario, such as everything needed to install and configure MySQL, and then it contains all of the components that are required to support that scenario.
